### Entropy and randomness


*Entropy* is one of the fundamental concepts of the *information theory*. *Entropy* gives us an information how data are ordered or how far we can predict them. It is interesting for *data compression* and also for security.

#### Entropy playground

There are applications for:

* present file entropy and bytes statistics,
* present bitmap specific information - entropy of its and how much colors where used,
* reduce number of bits used for RGB (**red/green/blue**) representation.

Use of the last one shows the impact of the color statistics on the image size in formats with supporting compression.
